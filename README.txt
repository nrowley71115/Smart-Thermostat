-------- INTRODUCTION --------
This project was written for two reasons. First, I wanted to build a smart thermostat (like a google nest) with the electronics I already owned, and second, to complete Harvard's online cs50 final project requirment. This project's scope is to make an IOT thermostat that functions as a normal thermostat with buttons and a display, but also connects to the internet allowing temperature control via computers and mobile devices through a web app.


-------- PARTS --------
Here I've listed all of the parts required to replicate my smart thermostat and some optional parts. I've included personal notes in parenthesis and links to purchase these devices with the price as of Sep 2023.

Required:
- Raspberry Pi 4B (could use other models, but this is what I had) https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/ - $35
- 4 Relay Module (I only used three for Fan, AC, and Heat control) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E0NSORY?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1 - $8
- I2C 16x2 LCD Display https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S7PJYM6?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details - $11
- DHT22 temperature & humidity sensor https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9BA0O4?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1 - $9
- Buttons (for physical thermostat system, fan, schedule, and temperature setpoint control) https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WF76VHT/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=AJJYA8M5YMCKV&th=1 - $6

Optional:
- Soldering Iron & solder
